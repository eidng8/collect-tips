Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the dependent libraries your project needs and it will install them in your project for you.
```
They provide a [installer](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe "Windows installer") for Windows. This installer also updates the `PATH` environment variable.
There are difficulties for people from inside China mainland to access outside world. We can use a [China mainland mirror site](http://pkg.phpcomposer.com/) for workaround.
